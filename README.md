## **Welcome Bonus Terms and Conditions**

When claiming bonuses, pay attention to:

*   **Min. Deposit**: Certain codes require a specific initial payment.
*   **Wagering Requirements**: Could range from 20x to 50x or more, depending on the code.

## **Wagering Requirements**

Wagering (or rollover) dictates how many times you must bet the bonus (and often the deposit) before you can withdraw:

*   **Illustration**: A £50 bonus with 40x wagering means you must place £2,000 worth of bets prior to withdrawing winnings from that bonus.
